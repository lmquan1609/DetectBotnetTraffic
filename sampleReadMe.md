# Travel Time Optimization via Ant Colony and Genetic Evolution

In this project, I tackled the travel time optimization problem for taxi vehicles. This can be framed as the *Traveling Salesman Problem*, a well-known computer science problem. The objective is to find the shortest route that visits a set of locations. For this problem, optimization techniques are required to intelligently search the solution space and find near-optimal solutions. More specifically, I first used XGBoost model to predict travel times between every pair of pick-up and drop-off locations. Then, I used evolutionary algorithms, namely ant colony and genetic, to find the best travel itinerary for the vehicles in the data.

## Dataset

The data is the [NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission Trip Record](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) data, already downloaded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data). I have the monthly data in the year 2016 for yellow taxi, green taxi, and for-hire vehicles. The dataset has close to 1.5 million trip records with 11 attributes.
